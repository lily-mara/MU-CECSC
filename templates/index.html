  <p>The Miami CEC Student Council was founded in 2012 by
  students enrolled within Miami University's School of Engineering
  and Applied Science (now College of Engineering and
  Computing). Dedicated to promoting engineering and uniting students
  together, the Miami Engineering Council not only advocates the work
  and research from their peers, but also hosts various campus-wide
  events.</p>
